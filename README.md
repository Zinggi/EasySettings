This Plug-in helps you with editing the Sublime Text 2 setting files.  
It displays all available settings through auto-completion.  
It also displays the documentation of the just accepted setting.  

To use it just **start typing** in a **user setting** file or press **ctrl+space** on an empty line for a full list of all available settings.

Installation
------------
**Very easy with [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) right inside Sublime Text 2 (Package Control needs to be installed):**

1.	Ctrl + shift + P
2.  Search for "inst", hit enter
3.  Search for "DictionaryAutoComplete", hit enter

**Manually (not recommended):**

1.  Clone or download this package
2.	Put it into your Packages directory (find using 'Preferences' -> 'Browse Packages...')
